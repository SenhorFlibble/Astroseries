AddTip("You can select all of your currently visible units of the same type by holding down the CTRL key and selecting a unit or by \"double clicking\" on a unit.")
AddTip("The more workers you have collecting resources, the faster your economy will grow.")
AddTip("Building more than one barracks will let you train more units faster.")
AddTip("Use your workers to repair damaged buildings.")
AddTip("Explore your surroundings early in the game.")

AddTip("You can demolish trees and rocks with long range rockets or long range plasma.")

AddTip("Battle Tanks and Mxets are awesome ground-to-ground combat units. Unfortunately, they move slowly and cannot defend themselves from air units.")


AddTip("A transport can fly your units from one location to another.")


AddTip("Armors and Kxets are great do-it-all combat units. They can fire farther than Battle Tanks and Mxets.  And they are fast, strong, and can hit any target, wether it is in land, sea, or air.")


AddTip("While transports can fight, only have them do so as a last resort. They will not engage enemy units unless specifically ordered to do so.")

AddTip("Air units are excellent for taking out Battle Tanks and Mxets, as these cannot strike back at air units.")

AddTip("Sea ships are not too expensive and have a good combat capacity. But be sure that they will be of any advantage to you before ordering too many, as enemies deep inside land are safe from these.")


AddTip("Only tanks and seaships require oil to be created. Starships do not. They only require minerals. They are powered by nuclear reactors!!! :-) ")


AddTip("Keep all workers working. Use ALT-I to find idle workers.")
AddTip("You can make units automatically cast spells by selecting a unit, holding down CTRL and clicking on the spell icon.  CTRL click again to turn off.")



-- Shift tips

AddTip("You can give an unit an order which is executed after it finishes the current work, if you hold the SHIFT key.")
AddTip("You can give way points, if you press the SHIFT key, while you click right for the move command.")
AddTip("You can order a worker to build one building after the other, if you hold the SHIFT key, while you place the building.");
AddTip("You can build many of the same building, if you hold the ALT and SHIFT keys while you place the buildings.")

AddTip("Use CTRL-V or ALT-V to cycle through the viewport configuration, you can than monitor your base and lead an attack.")



-- Astroseries tips

AddTip("Mechanical units, such as tanks and air fighters, can be repaired by workers.  Repairing damaged units is always cheaper than getting new ones.")

AddTip("Hospitals and Healing Areas can heal your non-mechanical troops.  Just move any injured unit near one and use the Cure option to heal all wounds.")

AddTip("Star Battlecruisers and Litans can be upgraded to have nukes on their respective building areas.  While nukes take long to be ready, they are a terrific weapon.")

AddTip("Nagoran Guards can be upgraded with blasters at the Blaster Factory, and best of all, they will continue to cost the same.")


AddTip("In the web site http://www.astroseries.com you can stay up to date with everything Astroseries related, as well as obtaining technical support, answers to questions, and every kind of Astroseries downloads!")
