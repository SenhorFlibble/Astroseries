<A NAME="Q0A"></A><B>What is Astroseries?</B><BR>
<BR>
Astroseries, or Astroseries RTS, as it is often known as, is a Realtime Strategy game set in a futuristic era, featuring a conflict between several interstellar nations.<BR>


<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Q1"></A><B>How do I start Astroseries?</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Double click on the freecraft.exe (or corresponding icon if on Linux or other operating system) icon present in this same directory.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="Q2"></A><B>The game does not start. What do I do?</B><BR>
<BR>
On some computers the game takes quite longer to load. Wait a bit. If, however, you suspect the game will not run, try reinstalling the game.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="Q3"></A><B>I was playing a campaign and saved a game. When I came back and tried to load it, the game crashed. What now?</B><BR>
<BR>
Please refer to the next question. It gives you the chance to skip levels in a campaign. Thats the best fix we have found to this problem so far. This problem is expected to be solved over time.<BR>
<BR> 
<BR>

<A NAME="Q4"></A><B>Can I skip levels in a campaign?</B><BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you can! While in the name of fun we recommend you to play all levels, there might be situations in which you will want to skip levels in a campaign. You might want to skip a level if:<BR>
<BR>

<UL>
 <LI>You are stuck in a level and cannot go on (for some reason).<BR>
 <LI>You saved a game but when you try to load it, the game crashes.<BR>
</UL>
<BR>

This version of Astroseries includes pre-saved games.  You may want to Load any of them from human01.sav.gz to human16.sav.gz for the Imperial Union, or nagoran01.sav.gz to human16.sav.gz for the Nagoran Empire.<BR>

<BR>
Besides the one described above, there are other two methods to skip levels. <BR>

<BR>
<B>Method 1</B><BR>
<BR>


1) During gameplay, press ENTER (so you can type a message)<BR>
<BR>
2) Type (lowercase and all like this) the following: <B>unite the clans</B><BR>
<BR>
3) Press ENTER again.<BR>
<BR>
The current level should end, in victory for you.  You will be taken to the next level in a campaign.  If you are using this because a saved game became corrupted and would not load, repeat for as many levels until you get to where you were :-)<BR>


<BR>
<BR>


<B>Method 2</B><BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a way of running individual levels. To play any given level any time, follow these steps:<BR>
<BR>
1) Run stratagus.exe (or the corresponding file if you are on Linux or other operating system)<BR>
2) From the menu, choose "Single Player Game".<BR>
3) A couple of options show up. Click on "Select Scenario". A dialog box show up.<BR>
4) In "Type", select Stratagus scenario (cm).<BR>
5) Then right below "Map size", you see a folder with an up arrow that says "maps" next to it. Click it.<BR>
6) Click on campaigns.<BR>
7) Now you are given two choices: human or nagoran  &nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the one you want. NOTE: human is the Imperial Union.<BR>
8) A list of maps show up, from level01a.cm to level16a.cm<BR>
9) Suppose you want to play level 9 from the human race, then click on level09h.cm<BR>
10) The dialog box closes. Map is ready. Now click on "Start Game".<BR>
11) Enjoy!<BR>

<A NAME="Q4P1"></A><B>The game behaves in a strange way</B><BR>
<BR>
  If the game behaves in a strange way, like there was sound before and now there isn't, or the mouse cursors are not those supposed to be, or any other erratic behavior, what you should do is  save the game, exit the program, and run again.  If when saving the game the keyboard does not respond (sometimes happens), choose default.sav.gz with the mouse and save there (that's what this file is for).  The next time you run the game, all those strange symptoms should be gone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<A NAME="Q4A"></A><B>When attacking planetary defenses, my units attack the planet and NOT the planetary defenses. How do I do?</B><BR>
<BR>
 If your units attack the planet instead of the planetary defenses, make them STOP (by clicking on their STOP button) so they stop the attack. They will pick and attack the correct target automatically.<BR>


<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="Q4B"></A><B>When using the Map Editor, how do I delete units?</B><BR>
<BR>
Move the mouse cursor over the unit you want to remove.  Then press the DELETE key on your keyboard.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="Q5"></A><B>What is FreeCraft?</B><BR>
<BR>
FreeCraft has been practically replaced by its much improved sucessor, Stratagus.  Read next question/answer for more information.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="Q6"></A><B>What is Stratagus?</B><BR>
<BR>
Stratagus is a gaming engine that lets you create your own RTS (Real Time Strategy) games, similar to WarCraft I / WarCraft II, StarCraft, Red Alert, Ages of Empires, etc.  So far, it can only create RTS games in 2D, but it is still very cool nonetheless.  Mastering the engine takes its time, as you at least need to have some scripting experience of any type to understand what it is all about. And making a game generally requires certain conmitment on the part of the creator, as it generally takes a good while.  A typical RTS game can easily take between two to four months, if not more, to complete.  Astroseries took about seven months to make, and a good while more to improve it over time.
