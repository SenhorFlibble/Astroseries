<b>The Short Story</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Incredible technology is achieved on Earth by the mid of the 21st century. But there are problems and a war happens soon after.  When the war end, the World becomes one single nation: The Imperial Union.  Ruled by 12 Red Czars, this government is iron fisted and all opposition is blasted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When space travel becomes more viable, a group from the opposing Secret Brotherhood manages to steal a Corintius Starship (the Arcon), and escape into the unknown, settling in a distant planet known as Zeus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In year 2104, the Imperial Union finds and invades Zeus.  The space exiles manage to escape once again.  One group of them try to launch a sneak atatck on Earth but fail.  The remaining space exiles decide to travel once again into unknown space... What fate will await them?<br>

<b>The Long Story</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So you want to know more details, huh? Allright, here it goes. By the year 2052, wonderful technology was achieved on Earth.  Much better medicines, atomic powered starships that could reach light speed, and even longer youth, it was all a reality.  But at the same time, deep social problems struck Earth, politics became more and more unstable, and a big war took place all around the world.  The war lasted around a decade, and one group of people, the *, were clearly prevailing.  After the war ended, the entire world became a single block, which became known as the Imperial Union, ruled by 12 leaders, who later on called themselves the Red Czars, controlling Earth with an iron fist.  The economical system as people knew it ceased to exist.  Despite all of this, a small elite formed itself around the Red Czars, and began living in the best places.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2065, small rebellions began to take place in very far corners of the world, but these were fiercely repressed, making clear that the Imperial Union would not take disobedience.  Over time, a group known as the Secret Brotherhood began to exist.  They created towns in far away regions of the world.  But thanks to the increasing number of air patrols created by the Imperial Union, which included earlier versions of the helifighter, these rogue towns were wiped out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2072, a lone unknown spacecraft entered the Solar System.  This rather small vessel did as if it was going to enter Earth without authorization, however, was dissuaded from doing so thanks to some weaponry that was mounted in what was once the International Space Station, as well as by a pair of laser positions located on Earth itself (originally designed to stop any incoming meteorite).  No actual combat took place, but it raised Imperial Union concerns in face of an outside menace.  Shortly after, the Imperial Union began plans for making the helifighters space capable.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2074, some humans on Earth who claimed to be aliens (called themselves Elo), told the Imperial Union that the lone vessel met three years earlier was a Nagoran Scout, which belonged to the Nagoran Empire, a group of xenophobic aliens.  The Elo themselves had already been at odds with the Nagoran Empire during the last two Earth decades. By this date, the Space Station's weapons were already upgraded, its shields improved, and other secondary orbital fire positions installed.  Some 40 helifighters were already space capable as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2075, a scientist known as Zulman managed to create some sort of magnetic field that allowed starships to travel faster than light, without causing anomalies aboard.  This slowly led to the creation of the next generation of starships.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2076, the Imperial Union ordered the construction of three Corintius spaceships.  They were aimed at exploring the solar system, carrying materials to and from other planets, and even defend Earth from an outside danger.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2077, the building of three Corintius starships was completed.  The crew chosen for one of them, the Corintius Arcon, however, were members of a cult known as the Secret Brotherhood.  This cult of people opposed the Imperial Union but were always unable to really damage the government.  By early 2078, the Arcon was given a mission to carry terraforming equipment to Mars.  Instead, halfway through, their leader, Captain Ardun, changed course to outside of the Solar System.  They went ahead at full speed, eventually reaching the speed 3.2 times faster than ligth speed.  After a flight of 7 years, they reached a star system, in 2085.  They called it Agamenides (Ganymede in their cult tongue), and settled into a planet which they called Zeus.  This planet was not like Earth at all, but it had a thin atmosphere, and frozen water.  The settlers found a deep valley, where they built their city.  The valley was covered by a huge glass dome.  They managed to raise trees, and even make a small lake taking the frozen waters from the north.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2088, with the help of the Elo, the Imperial Union colonizes planet Rotik, near the borders of the Interstellar Consortium and the Zyrronyan Empire.  The planet had plenty of minerals, and the Elo insisted in keeping a garrison in there to keep an eye on the neighbors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2092 a small vessel arrived to Zeus.  But it was neither Nagoran nor Terran.  There were a group of blue skinned aliens who came in a friendly way.  They called themselves the Garidis, and since they had nowhere to go, they became part of the community, and their technology contributed important advances to the Zeus colonists.  They even helped to make a group of starfighters to defend Zeus should a danger arise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2095 the Imperial Union learns about planet Zeus, thanks to a deep space staellite.  The Red Czars didn't want any of their enemies to continue to exist, and preparations begin to launch an assault on Zeus and destroy all of the exiles.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2100, the space exiles, with the help of the Garidis, mount a second colony in a dark planet known as Zomera in an adjacent system.  It was meant to create an escape area, if it was ever needed.  During the next year, the Garidis help exiles improve the quality of planet Zeus, by planting a very resilient type of plant, the Lilitre, which could survive with as little as sunlight and moderate water.  These shining plants would over time generate forests in Zeus.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In year 2104, the Imperial Union arrives to the Agamenides System and destroys the few perimeter defenders, and shortly after land an open invasion on Zeus.  There is some combat, but in the end a group of exiles manage to escape into space.  The Imperial Union goes behind in pursuit.  At some point, they lose track of the exiles, and instead run into Nagoran Empire forces, with which Earth and the Elo had been at odds for a good time.  This ultimately led to a formal mutual declaration of war.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Year 2105 saw increased war between the Imperial Union and the Nagoran Empire.  They began some kind of neutral planet invasion race. At some point, the Imperial Union invaded Nagoran planet of Arkidos.  It was then taken back.  Rotik began a rebellion but it was soon stopped. The Elo, who wanted to destroy a Nagoran planet so close to human borders, deviced a weapon, the Mega Starway, which reduced Arkidos to ashes.  By the end of 2105, the Nagorans managed to destroy the weapon itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In year 2106, Rotik starts another rebellion.  This one is harder to take down but is eventually pacified.  Some space exiles from Zomera try to hit Earth with a sneak attack but fail.  Remaining exiles left once again into unknown space... What fate will await them?<br>
