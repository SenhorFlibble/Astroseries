Mau Etmarin: -"Now that Mau Kamrak has arrived to the stronghold, peace and order will be restored to planet Grom shortly. Your actions is earning you a good reputation, that will someday help you in the future.  Right now we have something serious to care about. Near the Neutral Zone that we share with the Interstellar Consortium, there is an asteroid commonly known as The Skull Asteroid, which is home to many criminals, pirates, weapons dealers, fugitives, exilees and basically all the trash that exists in this region of space. They trade stolen items, weapons, starships, and do all the illegal stuff.  The Interstellar Consortium is acting in a blind way about them, maybe because these scoundrels help spies that constantly sabotage both our Nagoran Empire and the friendly to us Moybnyan Empire.  It is about time we taught these fiends who we are. Expect to find Exors, too. They are traitor Nagorans who long ago betrayed our people in favor of unknown interests, already at the era in which humanoids still had us subjugated, before the Great Warrior Kimrak the First freed our people, uniting Nagoran worlds with one purpose: To keep any humans and humanoids away from us. But coming back to now, your mission consists in destroying absolutely everything and everyone, in and nearby, The Skull Asteroid.  Even if that means destroying some Interstellar Consortium patrols as well."
