Mau Kamrak: -"Greetings, brave warrior! We have met before, and Mau Etmarin has recommended you for more glorious battles than those faced previously. It happens that several empires called for a summit of negotiations in Keloom.  Some of our envoys were invited, and when they reached there, shortly after, they were murdered by humans.  It appears that the humans have a plan to hit us hard and heavy deep into our empire. Or at least seems so, as the Interstellar Consortium, the Zyrronyan Empire, the Scavonian Star Nation and the Imperial Union seem to be getting on good terms.  As you know, Keloom is a star system located in their common borders.  Well, here is what I have been waiting for."
*** One nagoran warrior brings in a data disc ***
Mau Kamrak: -"Lets see what happened to our envoys."
*** An image of a female Nagoran envoy and some humans in a dark room shows up ***
Envoy: -"We came to negotiate our borders, not to fight!"
Human Soldier: -"Hahaha! Is that the way Nagorans figth for their borders? By begging mercy? Hahaha!"
Human Soldier 2: -"Comrade, we should teach these Nagorans a lesson. I could easily wipe out ten of them myself alone. Hahaha!"
*** The first human soldier hits the female nagoran envoy in the face with a fist ***
Human Soldier: -"Wow! Aren't Nagorans brave warriors? Whats the matter? Defend yourself!"
Human Soldier 2: -"Bah! Let me kill this insect."
*** The human soldier 2 gets an AK-47-C type of machine gun and kills the female Nagoran envoy with several shots ***
Human Soldier: -"Heh. And I wonder if that Project Super Nova they talk about will finish those scoundrels..."
*** Video ends ***
Mau Kamrak: -"Not only the humans are uniting together against us, but they have also made fun of unarmed females. This has caused rage across the Nagoran Empire. And what would Project Super Nova be? Nothing good, we can be sure. Our agents will try to learn more of it."
*** A Moybnyan Officer shows up on screen ***
Moybnyan Officer: -"Greetings, Nagorans! Since our races had a common origin, we will help you in the upcoming mission. The humans are enemies of our Moybnyan Empire as well. The Supreme Warrior Council has sent us to help you with several Rotkurs."
Mau KamraK: -"All help is appreciated. Warrior, you have your orders. You will proceed to Keloom, and summit or not, you will simply destroy everything and kill everyone. The humans are irrevocable enemies of our race, so be as cruel as you can. Take no prisoners, show no mercy. These cowards, female killing humans, don't deserve any."
