Mau Etmarin: -"Grom was successfully defended.  However, planet needs to be secured, as there have been some random forces around. Mau Kamrak needs to reach the stronghold located to the south east, in order to take command there and inform how the situation is in the region once he takes control. Your forces are to help him arrive safely there. Beware, we have reports that there are some guerrilla forces serving the Imperial Union that will try to hunt down your forces, so you will need to fight your way across."
Mau Kamrak: -"Don't worry, brave warrior! We will make it to the stronghold, and from there things will come under control."
Mau Etmarin: -"Your only task is to see Mau Kamrak alive to that stronghold. His forces will then come back together and get the situation back to normal."
