Mau Etmarin: -"Greetings, warrior! You have been promoted to a new sector, and will join in the ongoing war against the Imperial Union.  In this mission, we will invade a planet, Beta Dimus I, right in our border with the Imperial Union. They have already taken the planet and placed some planetary defenses, so in this mission, you will have to destroy the planetary defenses as well as any other defending unit so that we can proceed with the invasion in our next mission."
