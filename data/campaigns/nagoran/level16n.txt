Mau Etmarin: -"Tragedy has struck planet Arkidos...  We finally discovered what Project Supernova was. It is a deadly weapon located aboard an Imperial Union platform.  As you know, starways are used to transport cargo and individuals between two points. Starways are machines that temporirly open a wormhole between two well known locations. Well, that weapon we are talking about, is a huge, Mega Starway, that fires massive radioactive energy.  That huge amount of energy can only be generated in a planet with sophisticated equipment. Well, the Imperial Union is using the Mega Starway to let that highly destructive energy reach us from wathever location it is being generated.  It is with this Mega Starway that they reduced planet Arkidos to an ashland, killing almost everything and almost everyone, Mau Kamrak included...  And now this deadly platform is reachign further into Nagoran space, headed for our capital world, Nagora! However, it is right now in the star system of Katok Mor, and there we will stop it, brave warrior! Some Moybnyan Rotkurs are in the area to help us, as this also concerns our friends from the Moybnyan Empire. Know that the platform also has defenses of its own and that it will launch fighters to protect itself. As if it needed any defense...  Join up all forces, and destroy everything on that platform! And remember, the sooner you destroy the Mega Starway, the easier it will be to destroy the rest. Show these hated Red Czars what Nagorans are made of!"
