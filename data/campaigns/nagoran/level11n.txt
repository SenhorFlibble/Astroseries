Mau Etmarin: -"Congratulations in breaking down the enemy forces, however, some Imperial Union forces descended upon Moltok II planet and they have repelled the Nagoran Interceptors that tried to follow them into the planetary atmosphere.  So what we will do is land at a distance from them and from there coordinate further attacks. Fight bravely, warrior! As I have always said, your bravery will be worth it!"
