Mau Etmarin: -"You are being sent to the star system of Kaith Moltok in order to help our forces there take the planet Moltok II.  The planet itself holds no known civilization, but plants and beings were detected there, and the atmosphere of Moltok II is suitable for us. However, there are Imperial Union forces pretending this planet. We will have to destroy their forces in high orbit. Also, we have detected another group of humans, which seem to be known as Grecans, members of some "Star Confederation". Wait, our scanners have detected some of their starships leave the area in many directions. Only a small force of Grecans stayed behind."
Communications Warrior: -"Mau Etmarin,sorry for the interruption, but we have detected a transmission between Grecan forces."
*** Incoming transmission ***
Azul: -"This is Officer Azul contacting Captain Hotshot, several helyflies are headed for our asteroid cluster. We are disengaging. Prepare for trans-hyperspace...  . .. ."
*** Transmission ended ***
Mau Etmarin: -"Seems grecans are escaping from a group of space fighters from the Imperial Union. Allright, warrior, you know what you are up against. Destroy everything and everyone in this region.  Lets not mind about the remaining Grecans who escaped, they are worthless."
