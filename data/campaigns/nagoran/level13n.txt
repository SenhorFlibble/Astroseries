Mau Kamrak: -"Our attack on Keloom should have been more than enough to let these humans know that we are ready for them, should they decide to come. Still, our agents have not been able to discover what Project Super Nova is, but investigations will continue. Now you are being reassigned to a new task. Our Nagoran Empire has decided to recover planet Arkidos, lost to the Imperial Union some weeks ago. We will teach them that our planets are ours, and nobody's else."

Moybnyan Officer: -"Greetings, brother Nagorans!"
Mau Kamrak: -"Greetings, brother Moybnyans! We want to thank you for the help you provided us in the Keloom Battle."
Moybnyan Officer: -"You are welcome. We will continue to help your efforst against the Imperial Union, as the Moybnyan Empire, too, has declared formal war against the Imperial Union. They have been conducting sabotage against our supply convoys during the last few weeks, and thats what made us, among other reasons, to help you in Keloom.  We wish to recover Arkidos as much as you do. We have not been able to mobilize many starships yet there, but a small force of Moybnyan Rotkurs will accompany you."
Mau Kamrak: -"Thank you! Warrior, you will lead a force of attackers to the Arkidos Star System and destroy all enemy defenders that you find around planet Arkidos, so that we can proceed to an invasion on the planet itself. "
