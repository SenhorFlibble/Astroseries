Mau Etmarin: -"Your wiping out of the enemy bases is slowly earning you more and more honor.  If you continue like that, one day you could be the leader of your own colony. However, there is still more to do in this planet.  During our last battle, some enemy troops fled to the South Deserts.  These deserts are much more arid and desolate than this one.  There is no wood, and no oil, to harvest in there.  Only a few minerals might be found, and you will need to search for these. Our best bet is to turn east as soon as possible. And to make things harder, most of our warriors must stay here in order to guarantee the safety of our newly acquired region. Another problem you will have is that you cannot build aerial factories and thus cannot build any aerial units, due to the lack of technical support for such at the moment. So you will go to the South Deserts with a small force.  You will be provided with some wood to make buildings and some oil for tanks. "
*** Otmau Goruzduz enters ***
Mau Etmarin: -"Yes, Goruzduz?"
Goruzduz: -"I want to accompany this brave warrior to the South Deserts. I will bring with me some trainees that will act as gunmans, and a pair of old tanks that the enemy left behind, which I repaired myself."
Mau Etmarin: -"Allright, Goruzduz. Your help is welcome. Get going, brave warriors! Show the enemy what we Nagorans are made of!"
