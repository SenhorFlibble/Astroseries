Mau Etmarin: -"Greetings, warrior! We have been given the task of colonizing some worlds in the Tau Mara Star System. Our transports were ready here in Mintros III to go on such a mission but some Nyons, which are colonists of another race, have rebelled and taken the airport.  The Nyons only seem to be good at causing such troubles. Some of our other forces will calm them down later. For now, your only mission is to rescue the Aerial Factory in order to activate the transports.  Unfortunately, here in Mintros III we do not have plenty of more modern weapons, so you will have to do with wathever is available."
