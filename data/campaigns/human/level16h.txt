Master Yazin: -"Well, seems we have surrounded the Arkidos City, the capital of this planet. Getting here has not been easy, but we will storm the city and take this planet for ourselves, thus expulsing all Nagoran presence from our borders. With the Nagorans gone, we can resume our persecution of the grecans, now once again located in places unknown. But we will get the grecans, someday, even if it takes us years to come."
General Eliocan: -"Sorry for interrupting you, my Master, but we have received information that the Nagorans have received reinforcements from outer space. Apparently one of their fleets that was in a deep space mission somewhere. That fleet has plenty of starships."
Master Yazin: -"Hmmm... That will make our assault somewhat harder, but also demonstrates that the Nagorans are desperate, and that they will mount an insanely hard resistance.  I would suggest the use of Star Battlecruisers equipped with nuclear weapons, if we are going to break down their defenses, since they seem to be numerically superior to us."
Zeloy Vikes: -"I am here in representation of the Scavonian Republic. We have had good relations with the Imperial Union, and at the same time the Nagoran Empire has done far too many crimes in our space, so we will send a few more flying dishes to help you in your assault.  I hope their city of Arkidos get reduced to rubbles soon."
General Eliocan: -"Thank you for the help, Ambassador Vikes.  This will certainly strenghten up the relations between our nations."
General Yang Lao: -"The forces are in place and ready!"
Master Yazin: -"Good, Comrade Yang Lao. Fight bravely. We will storm them from the south. Konstantin Petrov, General Eliocan and me will be present in this battle, to witness our final victory on the Nagorans who ruined our original mission. Figth bravely, Comrades! We know of no defeat!"
