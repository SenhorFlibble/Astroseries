General Eliocan: -"Well, finally we will do what we came to do here in the Fosforus Star system. That is, we are to add planet Fosforus to our empire.  This planet is ruled by nobody as of yet, though there are Nagoran and Zyrronyan forces competing for supremacy in this planet. Obviously none of these forces will win, as the planet will be ours.  If it isn't, you are going to be sorry, so do not fail us now. In fact, one of the native nations want to join us, as they hate both Nagorans and Zyrronyans. They wear the purple color, so approach them with no fear.  They don't have too much to offer us, but they can help explain our presence in this planet. Over time they will be taugh the ways of the Red Czars.
