General Romanova: -"Good job in stopping that pitiful revolt, Comrade! However, there is no time to celebrate right now.  There is an urgent matter! Since our incident in the Neutral Zone with the Zyrronyans, General Eliocan has been to a conference in Nitmak, a planet in the Interstellar Consortium space. The Conference has ended successfully and once more we have avoided war with the Zyrronyan Empire. However, General Eliocan has not returned yet as there are rumors that the Nagorans want to kill him. It will be your duty, Comrade, to safely escort General Eliocan back to our waiting transport. Most people in this city are peaceful, but beware of wolves among the sheep."
