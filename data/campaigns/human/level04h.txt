General Eliocan: -"Good job in knocking out the water supply in that last mission, comrade! In this mission, you, along with some forces we have sent, will eliminate all enemies. They will try to resist hard and heavy, but their chances are dim now. We will await the glorious return of your forces from this mission. However, you must get moving, as even now the battle is already under way."
