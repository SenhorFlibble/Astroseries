General Eliocan: -"Bad news.  While we successfully took planet Zeus, many grecans fled aboard starships. We have followed the bulk of them nearby the Dufisto Star System, right into an asteroid field. We have found out that this region of space belongs to the Nagoran Empire, which is not friendly towards us at all. Until now we have tried to avoid open confrontation with them, but we need to destroy all grecans. Comrade Yazin is on his way to this region, and he has already given orders in advance. These grecan murderers must not escape, so your orders are to destroy everyone who opposes us, either Grecan or Nagoran. Also know that Grecans and Nagorans are not allied with each other; quite the contrary, they will figth each other if they meet, so keep your eyes open as battle areas can help you quickly find the grecans. Be fast and deadly. Fight bravely, Comrade!"
