General Eliocan: -"Greetings, Comrade! After so many decades of following this band of terrorists known as Grecans, but now, victory is finally at hand.  After these criminals are wiped out, our all powerful government will stand unopposed and our government can finally grow without any threats! In this mission, you are to prepare our small outpost at Delos 73, from where we will siege the planet Zeus, the haven of these scoundrels! Work hard, comrade, and glory will await you!"
