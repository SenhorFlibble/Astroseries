General Eliocan: -"In this mission, we are to destroy the Zeus water supply machinery.  This way, the Zeus City (the planet's capital) will not have endless water supply, thus making the next mission far easier.  According to the information supplied by radars, all you have to do is destroy the Machine Building, located in the center of the small enemy city.  Don't let anything oppose you."
