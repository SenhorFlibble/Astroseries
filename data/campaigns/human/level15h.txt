General Eliocan: -"Master Yazin has arrived, Comrade."
*** Deep silence as Yazin walks into the room ***
Master Yazin: -"Our advance into the planet of Arkidos has gone better than expected. Even so, we have lost several of our transports in the descent into the planet, as plenty of defenders still remain inside. We have recently established a foothold in the province of Kaith Zindrit, south east of the capital city.  General Yang Lao has established another foothold northwest of them, but before we can storm the main capital, we need to deal with outer defenders.  In Kaith Zindrit, you are to eliminate everything opposing us, and you will have to figth aggressively as Nagorans are preparing to mount a terribly hard resistance to our advancement.  General Konstantin Petrov will accompany you, along with some soldiers. The Escavonians still want the Nagoran threat away from here, so they have sent some more flying dishes ready to storm Kaith Zindrit, and later on, the capital itself."
