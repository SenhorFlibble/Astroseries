General Romanova: -"Comrade, we have finally arrived to Rotik IV.  The situation here is chaotic. Unknown operatives have stolen weapons and have established a camp north of our position.  They keep yelling heresies, demanding ridiculous things such as freedom of speech, a private life, and freedom to create and have their own homes, independent from government control. It is hard to believe some people to be wanting to go back to such primitive way of life, but thankfully it is the vast minortiy who think like that in here, less than one percent of the population.  There are probably no more than ten or fifteen people in this stupid revolt. Most people agree with our government and our own guerrillas have already captured some prisoners, and we will execute them, and after that, we will eliminate everyone opposing us.  For the Red Czars, fight bravely, Comrade!"
