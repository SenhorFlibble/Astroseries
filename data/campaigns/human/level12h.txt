General Eliocan: -"Greetings, Comrade! The Red Czars have appointed General Yang Lao in command of the Rotik System. A place formerly occupied by General Irina Romanova.  At this point, Irina Romanova has lost her immunity to bureaucratic moves, and several accusations are pending against her. She, along with some of her loyals, has decided to flee away into a planetoid. Maybe planning to go into Interstellar Consortium space later on. We can't let this happen, it might make our enemies think that we are losing power.  In this mission, your goal is simple: kill Irina Romanova.  We prefer to have a martyr than an internal defeat.  People will think she was killed by the monoliths present in this region.  Speaking of which, you don't have to kill all the Nagoran forces, but it is up you, if you prefer.  One last thing, we believe Irina Romanova is hiding somewhere in the north east, while the Nagoran bases are in the center and in the northwest."
